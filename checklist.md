Project Checklist:

Start Page:
1) Be able to set output directory
2) Be able to configure download bitrate
3) Be able to search for artist's albums individually, then when you click the album it shows all songs on the album

Spotify Search Page:
1) Be able to interchange seemlessly between failed search, successful search, invalid entry.

Download Page:
1) Add extra text (animated text) when api calls take longer than usual

Display Page:
1) Center final display frame
2) Add an image or more interesting texture as background
3) Add a subtle frame around album cover image
4) Configure buttons (proceed, save changes, discard changes)

BUGS:
- images downloaded to output folder during confirmation stage when applying media tags
- Refresh window doesn't work properly, app crashes if you start downloading a 2nd songs (cmd shows: 'RUSH TO 25!', then gets stuck on 'waiting' loop)
